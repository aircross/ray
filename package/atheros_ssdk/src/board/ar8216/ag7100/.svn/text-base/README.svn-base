How to build ag7100_mod.ko with SSDK tegother.

1.Copy SSDK kernel space library to current directory. When SSDK main part runs
  in kernel space it's ssdk_ks_km.a and when SSDK main part runs in user space
  it's ssdk_ks_um.a.

2.Modify your makefile. SSDK header file search path should be added to makefile.
  and SSDK kernel space library should be added as link object.

3.Add SSDK init operation and clean up operation in your system. How to configure
  the initialization please refer the SSDK user guide document.

4.Please remember generate and modify file build_mode.h. The file build_mode.h can
  be generated by run script file config2h.pl. In build_mode.h file please define
  macro MODULE_TYPE_KSLIB or MODULE_TYPE_USLIB correctlly.

5.In your source code please include build_mode.h at first before any other SSDK header
  files.
